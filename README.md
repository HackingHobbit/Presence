# Presence
 A sample project showing the process from Figma to a JavaScript/HTML/CSS mobile web app.

A Figma prototype of what I more or less have in mind can be viewed at: 

https://www.figma.com/proto/vkLWQcFPdAe9dMovHwW7TO/App-Layout-v1?page-id=0%3A1&type=design&node-id=1-600&viewport=-1123%2C3%2C1&t=8A8pcyJiDkbpIzs8-1&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=1%3A600&mode=design

Truthfully, I am more focused on the development of the app, and since I am a team of one, and I only had a few hours to spend on design, that was as far as I could get in the time I had.  Various iterations are likely to occur during development, out of the normal sequence of production.  This is normally not the best way to do things, but I feel okay doing it this way as an exercise, considering that things are not always ideal in the real world, so maybe it is useful to practice "having" to achieve my goal through imperfect means.   I am sure this is more internal dialog than anyone cares to read, but there it is. :-)
